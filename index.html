    <p id="title">Some encouragement from an egg, a potato, and a tea leaf</p>
    <p id="page2title">
      Imagine that an egg, a potato, and a tea leaf are each cooked in pots of
      boiling water.
    </p>
    <p id="page3title">
      After some time, they are taken out. The egg, soft and fragile before, is
      now solid and firm. The potato, hard as a rock before, is now soft and
      mushy. And the tea leaf changed the water from clear to a sage green.
    </p>
    <p id="page4title">
      Each item was placed into the same conditions - boiling water - but each
      had a different transformation.
    </p>
    <p id="page5title">
      So...if you are ever feeling down for not having same results as everyone
      else, do not be! You have unique qualities to use to your advantage :)
